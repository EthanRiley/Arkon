@charlesstewart hmm... wht is the age demographic for the game?
charlesstewart - Yesterday at 11:30 AM
"young people"
I'd go ~year 8.
UNKDevE - Yesterday at 11:30 AM
okay... then my game is wwaaaay to dark.
charlesstewart - Yesterday at 11:31 AM
Yes. That's why mine has no... lore, or story, of any kind.
UNKDevE - Yesterday at 11:31 AM
eh... i keep it as satire.
ukw, we could see "young people" as teenagers.
so im fine then
charlesstewart - Yesterday at 1:07 PM
@UNKDevE You've seen kivy, haven't you? Python lib. Looks great.
Just ordered 7inch touch screen for Pi, gonna have fun.
UNKDevE - Yesterday at 1:09 PM
yup.

UNKDevE - Today at 1:52 AM
some sprites+walk anims me been working on.
UNKDevE - Today at 6:32 PM
thought i reposed.
charlesstewart - Today at 10:29 PM
@UNKDevE Looking over Arkon repo, hope you don't mind me critiquing it: the ideologies (great idea, btw), a) shouldn't they be mutually exclusive? b) some look quite unbalanced? and c) there are quite a few. Do you aquire the ability to use each over time, or are you presented with all from the start?
UNKDevE - Today at 10:37 PM
no not at all critque away.
i was worried that they might be unbalenced
any way the idea is that an idealogy on lasts for a certain amount of turns
i was basing  them around spells etc...
the ones that confilicti will be mutlally exclusive to each other e.g. theism and atheism
also you can have multiple idealogies.
charlesstewart - Today at 10:40 PM
So I'm looking in story.txt - what about realism and the eightfold path?
UNKDevE - Today at 10:40 PM
hmm...
i don't know.(edited)
eightfold path is more extensialism.
but ur  right.
charlesstewart - Today at 10:41 PM
Beside the point that many people who follow the eightfold path would probably describe themselves as realistic, more importantly, why choose realism when there is eightfold?(edited)
UNKDevE - Today at 10:42 PM
ah beacuse eightfold will be later on in the game.
charlesstewart - Today at 10:42 PM
ah...ok...
But anyway - if it were not a GCSE project and were slightly less angsty, I would be inclined to attempt to persuade you to let me help out. You've got some really good ideas so far.(edited)
UNKDevE - Today at 10:45 PM
yeh it is very angsty.
jamierocks - Today at 10:45 PM
@UNKDevE when I was looking over it I found some bugs btw

Arkon - a game I am making for my GCSE

(semi-colons - there are more but I won't link them :P)
although pythons does compile them :S
UNKDevE - Today at 10:46 PM
oh ðŸ˜›
well that does not really matter.
charlesstewart - Today at 10:46 PM
Not really a bug.
forgetten word
UNKDevE - Today at 10:47 PM
any way of making less angsty?
jamierocks - Today at 10:47 PM
I also noticed you spelt self wrong in a commit
but i can't fint it
UNKDevE - Today at 10:48 PM
i think i fixed that, i am using a linter soo....
charlesstewart - Today at 10:48 PM
Just tried to search repo for "self", then realised what a stupid idea that was.
jamierocks - Today at 10:49 PM
suprised the linter doesn't moan about ;
UNKDevE - Today at 10:49 PM
it wouldn't.
it obvously uses the python interpriter as a backend.
jamierocks - Today at 10:49 PM
oh of course
charlesstewart - Today at 10:49 PM
@UNKDevE this.

UNKDevE - Today at 10:50 PM
thought so.
right - how are we going to refactor the story.
hmm... i was going to add story as the good bits.
i think we should remove home and prom
jamierocks - Today at 10:52 PM
btw go is awesome ðŸ˜„ https://git.lexteam.xyz/PastPapers/Site
charlesstewart - Today at 10:52 PM
Sorry, just found an interesting track. Erm... so these are like events, but you describe them as "battles". And the story is like a series of them. Is this a finished list?
UNKDevE - Today at 10:53 PM
No.
the "battles" will be somewhat of a typical RPG fight.
charlesstewart - Today at 10:53 PM
So the story doesn't happen in the battles.
jamierocks - Today at 10:53 PM
I thought your game would be similar to the yawhg
that's what I got from the spec
UNKDevE - Today at 10:54 PM
that would be easier.
and i should probably do, but it does not have much gameplay elements.
charlesstewart - Today at 10:55 PM
The Yawhg: the RPG.
UNKDevE - Today at 10:55 PM
lel.
should i remove battles then?
jamierocks - Today at 10:55 PM
speaking of the yawhg - that's be a very simple game to clone ðŸ˜›
charlesstewart - Today at 10:56 PM
Garh! Trying to watch a livestream, (psycho)analyse a video game design and listen to bass-y high-volume music is tough!
Maybe.
jamierocks - Today at 10:56 PM
lol
UNKDevE - Today at 10:57 PM
ah lel.
charlesstewart - Today at 10:57 PM
Don't remove the battles.
RPGs are cool and this is a great design.
UNKDevE - Today at 10:57 PM
ok... good point it is a unqiue part of the game.
hmm....
charlesstewart - Today at 10:59 PM
So how relevant are the events in the snippet to the story?
UNKDevE - Today at 11:00 PM
they change the charicter stats while giving them key items.
if you keep on losing them,
charlesstewart - Today at 11:00 PM
Not the game, the plot.
Are they major points?
UNKDevE - Today at 11:00 PM
depends how dark the game can be.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:00 PM
7
UNKDevE - Today at 11:01 PM
ok.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:01 PM
... I don't know.
UNKDevE - Today at 11:01 PM
after a certain amount of losses in battles, the player would get frequent battles with depression.
then cronic depression.
which would then lead to self harm and suicide.
and thats a very very sad way of losing a game.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:03 PM
Basically, you don't want teachers or examiners to send you to a psychiatrist. But you want to... discuss, or raise, your themes.
So... subtly and reference are key.(edited)
Subtly?(edited)
UNKDevE - Today at 11:03 PM
yes you are right.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:04 PM
brb
UNKDevE - Today at 11:04 PM
mkay.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:05 PM
So the depression idea's good.
UNKDevE - Today at 11:06 PM
yes it is.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:06 PM
Don't call it depression.
UNKDevE - Today at 11:06 PM
good idea.
why not instead make the player relive the battle
but every time they lose it gets darker.
until the can't see and the game ends.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:06 PM
Could it extend the length of the battle?
Because they're gonna be re-doing them anyway, if they keep losing?
UNKDevE - Today at 11:07 PM
hmmm.....
lets make it so you can't lose a battle.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:08 PM
Well that's... upbeat?
UNKDevE - Today at 11:09 PM
no, in my game they're are no temporary debuffs or buffs.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:09 PM
I just mean the idea that you can't lose a battle is suprisingly positive.
I guess you... win badly?
Which is kind of... not good?
UNKDevE - Today at 11:10 PM
you will lose determination perminently.
so when you have lost all you determination,(edited)
charlesstewart - Today at 11:11 PM
ya die.
UNKDevE - Today at 11:11 PM
yeah thats how it was going to be.
or we could have it that an external source always helps you out.
for example; a stranger helps you up in the cycle ride
charlesstewart - Today at 11:13 PM
Can I ask why a ballroom?
UNKDevE - Today at 11:14 PM
oh that, beacuse of the music i was listening to at the time
and i needed inspritation
charlesstewart - Today at 11:14 PM
Level of surreal-itude?
UNKDevE - Today at 11:14 PM
its pixel art
here is one of them(edited)

it's mid-surreal.
also the ballroom will be replaced with this scene.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:16 PM
this ^
?
UNKDevE - Today at 11:16 PM
ah.
it was going to be a cutscene(edited)
where the girl and the boy met.
from walk anims
charlesstewart - Today at 11:17 PM
Well they sound like interesting characters?
UNKDevE - Today at 11:17 PM
they're not.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:17 PM
Oh.
OK.
UNKDevE - Today at 11:17 PM
you see, that was not my intention.(edited)
i wanted this game to be a dark, satirical representation of life
very angsty i know.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:19 PM
I mean, you could just embrace the angst.
Some satir-y stuff works well like that.
UNKDevE - Today at 11:19 PM
i don't really want to lose meaning from it though
which is that philosphy and belifs can help you with your life.
maybe to go on futher to be your life.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:21 PM
Er, also, do you think a piece of coursework is the best way to express this?
UNKDevE - Today at 11:21 PM
no.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:21 PM
Wait, what? One's life, or mine?
Er, yes, no, it's not.
UNKDevE - Today at 11:22 PM
hmm... not to another person.
what people you percive is what you are.
to everyone else but you.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:23 PM
OK. I'm sure that's deep, but... I mean, you could make this engine type thing and use it for GSCE and then make this later?
UNKDevE - Today at 11:23 PM
yes i could.
and that is what i am doing(ish)
charlesstewart - Today at 11:24 PM
Oh?
UNKDevE - Today at 11:24 PM
it's mainly resource classes.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:24 PM
Is this part of somehing bigger?
Oh, yeah, atm.
UNKDevE - Today at 11:24 PM
yeah, items would be loaded from json files.
so would be 'moves' or idealogy
allthough the base types of theese would still be loaded
e.g. health poition
charlesstewart - Today at 11:26 PM
OK. I'm gonna go now/soon. Basically, make it less obviously angsty, is my advice.
UNKDevE - Today at 11:26 PM
yes i agree, but how?(edited)
remove exam and ballroom?
remove the battles?(edited)
charlesstewart - Today at 11:27 PM
Eh... subdue the themes.
UNKDevE - Today at 11:27 PM
yes agreed.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:27 PM
I guess when the ideas are written down, they're easier to... er... see.
UNKDevE - Today at 11:28 PM
yup.
charlesstewart - Today at 11:28 PM
So dress it up.
Bye.
UNKDevE - Today at 11:28 PM
OK.
jamierocks - Today at 11:28 PM
see ya
charlesstewart - Today at 11:28 PM
To anybody else reading this: you saw nothing.
jamierocks - Today at 11:29 PM
